      <abstract>
        <p>This paper examines how far new media technologies are transforming the nature of risk in contemporary society. It focuses on the ways in which the Internet came to act as a key vehicle for the rapid circulation of news, rumors,and hoaxes, as well as displays of public grieving, in the wake of September 11. The paper concludes by reassessing theories of "risk society" in relation to growing anxieties about the nature of future terrorist attacks. It suggests that there is an urgent need to understand how the dynamics of new media technologies are altering the ways in which we perceive such risks.</p>

forms o f interaction on a global scale. We live in an age w h e r e we are saturated
with information about potential risks. The power struggle over how these
risks are defined and assessed is played out on the global media stage. Indeed,
new media play a key role in legitimizing perceived risks through offering
assessments about whether they are "real" or "perceived." As Adam and Van
Loon argue: "The media do not simply 'pass on' particular relations o f risk
definition, but constitute them. Media are hence part of the mode of risk
production" (2000:26).</p>
      <p>The attacks on the World Trade Center were highly symbolic, creating an
international media spectacle and a climate of fear. As Shpiro observes:
Communication technology developments, such as digital satellite broadcasting,
cellular communications and the Internet, have turned terrorism into a live show, which could
be seen stage by stage, much like a prepared script. Although both aircraft that crashed
into the World Trade Center took off simultaneously from Boston, the terrorists delayed
the impact of the second kidnapped aeroplane on the North Tower, ensuring that every
television camera in New York would be focused on their murderous activities. (Shpiro,
2002:80)</p>
      <p>There is a symbiotic relationship between the news media and terrorists,
even if some of their goals are at odds with one another. Clearly, terrorists
tailor their attacks to try to gain maximum media publicity and the "new
terrorism" is increasingly dependent upon new m e d i a technologies. As C o n w a y
argues:</p>
      <p>Every machine connected to the Intemet is potentially a printing press, a broadcasting
station, or a place of assembly. And in the twenty-first century, terrorists are availing of
the opportunity to connect. The Internet is an ideal propaganda tool for terrorists: in the
past they had to communicate through acts of violence and hope that those acts
garnered sufficient attention to publicise the perpetrators cause or explain their ideological
justification. With the advent of the Internet, however, the same groups can disseminate
their information undiluted by the media and untouched by govemment censors. (2002:
2-3)</p>
      <p>
        The Internet provides terrorists with a platform with which to reach a mass
audience and an important means o f fundraising. Also it provides terrorists
with much greater direct control over their message compared to the
traditional television and print media. Terrorist organizations' Internet sites allow
for more extensive background information, they can mobilize people to take
action, and often they conceal their reliance upon the use of violence to achieve
political goals
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43 ref8">(Tsfati and Weimann, 2002)</xref>
        . In the aftermath o f 9/11
considerable efforts have been made by governments to monitor e-mail and Internet
traffic, and block terrorist organizations from using the Internet
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26 ref38 ref39">(Scheeres,
2001b)</xref>
        . However, this appears to have only been partially successful

      <title>Technology and Networks of Terror</title>
      <p>
        Publicity has been the main aim of terrorists throughout h i s t o r y - - b u t their
means of propaganda has been greatly enhanced by technological
developments in mass communications, especially with rise of the Internet
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(Nacos,
2000)</xref>
        . Terrorism is a form of theater designed to feed upon public anxiety and
fear
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43 ref8">(Coombs, 2003; Tsfati and Weimann, 2002)</xref>
        . However, with globalization
and the development of new communications technology, the scope and scale
of impact has changed. As Nacos notes:
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the theatre metaphor remains instructive, it has given way to that of terrorism
as a global television spectacular, as breaking news that is watched by international
audiences and transcends by far the boundaries of theatrical events. (2003:3)
Indeed, the nature of political conflict itself has altered. With the rise of the
networked society conflicts increasingly revolve around knowledge
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13 ref43 ref8">(Arquilla
and Ronfeldt, 2002; Castells, 1996)</xref>
        . Arquilla and Ronfeldt introduced the term
"netwar" to describe a newly developing form of conflict that is played out in
the information society. The term "netwar" is defined as:
...an emerging mode of conflict (and crime) at societal levels, short of traditional military
warfare, in which the protagonists use network forms of organisation and related
doctrines, strategies and technologies attuned to the information age. (2001: 6)
They go on to explain that "netwar" is not restricted to the Internet and new
technologies are not essential for people using such means. Indeed, it is often
the case that people will use a mixture of new technology and some very
lowtech methods. AI-Quaeda is an example of a new networked terrorist group in
the Middle East employing a combination of high- and low-tech methods.
Such groups are characterized by a non-hierarchical, flexible structure that is
loosely coordinated
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35 ref4 ref49 ref7">(Zanini and Edwards, 2001)</xref>
        . Often there is no single
figurehead or "leader" who can be targeted and the existence of cells makes it
more difficult for intelligence agencies to track down individuals.
      </p>
      <p>O s a m a Bin L a d e n had clearly d e v e l o p e d an e f f e c t i v e m e d i a s t r a t e g y
well in advance of the 9/11 attacks. A major part of this was the making of
prerecorded video films calling for a "holy war" against the United States.
Shpiro claims: "Video as a m e d i u m o f c o m m u n i c a t i o n s has long b e e n in
use within extremist terror groups. It is not only a visual tool c a p a b l e of
arousing e m o t i o n s but also authenticates, to a large degree, the origin o f
the message" (2002:81). However, in several cases it has proved very
difficult to authenticate tapes that have supposedly been made by Bin Laden,
although the authorities have been quick to seize on them. In the past Bin
Laden has made extensive use o f satellite t e l e c o m m u n i c a t i o n s until these
were intercepted. Alongside this, the a l - Q u a e d a n e t w o r k has m a d e
extensive use of the Internet.</p>
      <p>
        N e w media technologies have clearly aided the formation of terrorist
networks in three main respects. They have reduced the cost and the time
involved in communication and coordination, and they have enabled the sharing
of complex information through video conferencing, e-mail, and w e b sites
over a geographically dispersed area
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35 ref4 ref48 ref49 ref7">(Monge and Fulk, cited in Zanini and
Edwards, 2001: 35-6)</xref>
        . Bin Laden is said to have developed a communications
network incorporating e-mail, bulletin boards, and the web, with the help of
Egyptian computer experts such as Yasser al-Serri. As Zanini and Edwards
argue:
      </p>
      <p>Using the Internet for communication can increase speed of mobilisation and allow
more dialogue between members, which enhances the organisation's flexibility, since
tactics can be adjusted more frequently. Individuals with a common agenda and goals
can form subgroups, meet at a target location, conduct terrorist operations, and then
readily determine their relationships and re-disperse. (2001:36)</p>
      <p>
        Not only has the Internet helped coordination, Osama Bin Laden's network
was able to obtain details about the design layout of the World Trade Center, as
well as information about the aerial application of pesticides, from documents
accessed over the web
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref43 ref8">(Booth and Dunne, 2002; Conway, 2002)</xref>
        . The
hijackers also b o o k e d a number of their airline tickets online and were known to
have created temporary accounts using e-mail providers, such as Hotmail, that
ensured a high level of anonymity. It has been widely claimed that al-Qaeda
employed encryption in their communications on the Internet
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20 ref25">(for example,
Der Derian, 2002; Kelley, 2001)</xref>
        . However, it appears that they used code
w o r d s rather than the m o r e s o p h i s t i c a t e d m e t h o d s o f e n c r y p t i o n or
steganography (hiding secret data in the pixels of a picture file). Some reports
have suggested that plans for the 9/11 attack were hidden in pornographic web
sites
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">(for example, see Kelley, 2001)</xref>
        . In this case senior FBI officials have
repeatedly stated in briefings that they had found no evidence to support this
claim
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref11 ref11 ref15 ref26 ref27 ref34 ref35 ref4 ref46 ref49 ref7 ref9">(Conway, 2002; Weisman, 2001; Carvin, 2001; Campbell, 2001a and
2001b)</xref>
        . But the FBI and CIA clearly believe that terrorist groups are using
such technologies to facilitate attacks
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29 ref30 ref44 ref6">(see Ballard et al., 2002; Lyman, 2001;
McCullagh, 2001; USA Today, 2001)</xref>
        . Following the 9/11 attacks much greater
electronic surveillance has been introduced and hundreds of w e b sites have
been closed down

      <title>Online Journalism in the Age of Netwar</title>
      <p>
        Many commentators have claimed that 9/11 was a key moment in the
history of Internet; that this was when online journalism really came into its own.
Following earlier large-scale mediated disasters such as the Oklahoma City
Bombing and the TWA 800 Explosion, September 11 has been heralded as the
biggest story yet to break in the age of new media
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Allan, 2002)</xref>
        . The terrorist
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon crippled the United States
of America within a few hours. The images, repeatedly shown on television
screens around the western world, captured the real horror o f the event and led
the way for the first few hours. Just under thirty minutes after the first plane hit
the north tower o f the World Trade C e n t e r the e d i t o r o f the n e w s g r o u p
slashdot.com, not known as a "news site," posted a message detailing the
events. For the next twenty-four hours this kind of alternative news site
managed to keep online, despite a huge increase in traffic
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">(King, 2001)</xref>
        . Indeed,
such was the demand for information that major news sites on the Internet
were completely jammed within a very short space of time. The events of 9/11
are a prime example of a network war. As Der Derian observes:
"Technologically driven events outpaced organic modes of comprehension, and human
actions, whether out of trauma or information overload, seemed increasingly
to resemble machinic reflexes" (2002:107). Subsequently, over the next few
days there was a drop in the number o f U.S. Internet users trying to access
news sites to gain further information on the background to the events.
However, levels of Internet access were to rise again to levels beyond those prior to
the event. The creation of web site archives of the events of 9/11 created a
virtual sense of collective memory.
      </p>
      <p>What is clear is that this news event affected Internet accessibility in a way
in which no other had impacted upon it before. A number of reasons can be
identified for this. The collapse of the World Trade Center itself caused major
problems for broadcasting as a number of radio and TV stations lost their
transmitter towers in the explosion. Although some stations were able to use
backup transmitters, some were completely unable to function. Long distance
telephone lines were cut o f f when the North Tower collapsed, affecting the
infrastructure linking a number of major network sites to the Internet.
Telephone lines in some areas quickly became jammed. In the immediate
aftermath of the disaster people were generally able to e-mail friends and relatives.
It was not long, however, before web sites became inaccessible due to the
sheer volume of traffic.</p>
      <p>
        The Pew Internet and American Life Project conducted a number of
telephone surveys of people's Internet use in the United States, both before and
after the events of 9/11. While the findings of such surveys must be treated
with caution (for example, non-response rates or questionwording) they
suggest that almost half of Internet users experienced problems accessing the news
sites they were trying to reach on September 11. According to the findings,
general Internet use fell during the days after the attack. However, the use o f
the Internet as an information-gathering tool substantially increased compared
to earlier periods. Many people in the United States turned to international
news sites in their quest for information, particularly the BBC news site
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref42">(Allan,
2002; Stanton, 2002)</xref>
        . Also, people made increased use of government and
NGO web sites, such as those run by the Red Cross:
      </p>
      <p>
        Pew Internet Project surveys show that on an average day online in the four weeks before
the terror attacks, 22% of Internet users got some kind of news, often by chancing upon
news items while they were browsing or doing other activities on Web sites. On the day
of the attack, 28% of Internet users were getting news and in the period of September
1219, 27% were getting news on a typical day. Overall, 50% of Internet users, or about 53
million people, went online looking for news about the attacks and the aftermath at
some point in the first three weeks after attacks.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">(Pew Internet Organisation, 2001: 8)</xref>
        Television was still the primary news source, even among the heaviest
regular Internet users. Yet the Internet was significant in the way it was used
interactively in the days after the event, when people posted personal accounts of
the tragedy, individual responses, photographic records, and video footage
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">(Langfield, 2002)</xref>
        . Journalists themselves increasingly participated in Internet
chat rooms and online bulletin boards in their quest for new eyewitness
accounts
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Allan, 2002)</xref>
        . There is some evidence that people sought out
alternative news sites, particularly when the major news sites became inaccessible.
Also, a number of little-known w e b sites in the Middle East were accessed,
such as Islam Online &lt;www.islamonline.net&gt; and the satellite news channel
al-Jazeera &lt;www.aljazeera.net&gt;. As Allan notes: "From one w e b site to the
next, an array of alternative voices and viewpoints came to the fore, many
systematically marginalized, even silenced, in the mainstream Western media"
(2002: 131). N e w w e b sites sprung up providing a host o f information on
breaking news, personal reactions, and differing perspectives about possible
motives for the attacks
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref24">(Guest, 2001; Katz, 2001; Raphael, 2002)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        The top ten Google search terms relating to the terrorist attacks were: "cnn,"
" w o r l d trade center," " b b c , " " p e n t a g o n , " " m s n b c , " " o s a m a bin laden,"
"nostradamus," "american airlines," "fbi," and "barbara olsen"
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">(Wiggins,
2001)</xref>
        . Similarly, the most frequently used Lycos search words included: "world
trade center," "nostradamus," "New York," " o s a m a bin laden," "terrorism,"
"pentagon," "Afghanistan," "Camp David," "fbi," "Palestinians," and "Taliban"
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(Mariano, cited in Allan, 2002: 132)</xref>
        . Interestingly, government agencies, such
as the Pentagon and the FBI, feature strongly in both cases. Initially Google
advised people to turn to TV or radio to find out details of breaking news,
given the inability of the web to cope with such demand and the home page
gave links to the Washington Post, CNN, and Yahoo News. However, it was
not long before Google changed its policy and decided to provide users with
an increasing array of news links. As Wiggins observes: "By offering an
authoritative human-edited list of news, donation and rescue sites, Google
provided the services one would expect o f a portal" (2001:8). The significance
here is that Google began to perform the role of an editor in sifting through
sources and deciding which ones were the most useful and trustworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Internet also acted as a conduit for a host of rumours that circulated in
the aftermath of 9/11. Rumours quickly multiply in a climate of fear where
people are searching for some sense of meaning and control over the situation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref34">(Cassel, 2002; Newitz, 2001)</xref>
        . The myths included: the rumour that Nostradamus
had predicted the attacks, that the image of Satan appeared in the photographs
of the twin towers, that C N N used old footage to falsely show Palestinians
celebrating after the attacks, and the claim that thousands of Jews had been
pre-warned of the attacks and did not turn up to work that day
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22 ref36">(O'Leary, 2001;
Emery, 2003)</xref>
        . It was not long before sites were developed that sought to
identify false rumours (for example, see &lt; w w w . s n o p e s . c o m / r u m o r s &gt; . It would
clearly be in terrorists' interests to fuel fear and anxiety by playing a role in the
circulation of such rumours, but it would be very difficult to prove this had
taken place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much attention has been paid to assessing the likely nature of bio-terrorism
and risks that cannot be immediately detected by our senses. As Waisbord
observes: "Like the risk of terrorism, the threat of bio-terrorism only became a
risk worth media coverage after it materialised and resulted in billions of
dollars of losses" (2000:209). Such risks appear largely intangible and unreal
until actual symptoms manifest themselves, but the media can play a role in
heightening levels of public concern
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Adam, Beck, and Van Loon, 2000)</xref>
        .
Different interests in society struggle with one another over their particular
ideologies of risk and official sources tend to gain precedence. Media
representations provide the public with important information with which to assess
the vulnerability of individuals and to form judgements as to who is
responsible. A study by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">Waisbord (2000)</xref>
        found that in the case of early U.S.
covera g e of the anthrax scares the media c o n v e y e d the lack of consensus among
experts who were clearly very divided as to what to do. Reporting tended to
frame the anthrax scares in terms of the al-Quaeda connection and potentially
fuelled anxieties about further bio-terrorism attacks. Yet we cannot draw any
conclusions about audience responses simply upon the basis of a content
analysis study that focuses on news media representations. Audience responses are
very complex and people read a whole variety of meanings into media texts,
as the work of the Glasgow University Media Group demonstrates

        Despite the significance of new media technologies, traditional television
and print media are still centrally important as vehicles that potentially fuel
public fear and anxiety. The act of political violence itself is still the best way
to obtain publicity, not simply the circulation of information via the Internet.
Gaining blanket news coverage is designed to reach target populations e n
m a s s e , generate a debate about the motives for an act of political violence, and
enable leaders to achieve prominence
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(Nacos, 2000)</xref>
        . Electronic media within
the western world do, however, play a key role in legitimizing particular risks
over others and the speed at which communication occurs allows for the rapid
spread of both information and misinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
        At present the Internet is still being used mainly for propaganda purposes
and to provide a secure means of communication, but in the future cyber
terrorism may well become more of a threat (Whine, 1999). H o w far will
terrorists increase their dependence upon IT in the future? This depends upon how
far new media technologies serve their goals and offer a secure means of
operation. Will we see the emergence of what Zanini and Edwards label a new
breed of "terrorists c u m hackers" mounting most of their attacks in cyberspace?
This might include such tactics as automated e-mail bombs, computer viruses,
computer break-ins, web blockades and sit-ins, and web hacks
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref17 ref18 ref19 ref27 ref34 ref42">(see Damphouse
and Smith, 1998; Denning, 2001a; Stanton, 2002)</xref>
        . Soon after the 9/11 attacks
a group o f hackers calling themselves the Dispatchers said they would bring
down web servers and Internet access in Afghanistan and target countries that
support terrorists
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18 ref19 ref26">(Denning, 2001b)</xref>
        . Denning maintains:
      </p>
      <p>In assessing the threat of cyber terrorism it is important to look beyond the traditional
terrorist groups and to the computer geeks who already possess considerable hacking
skills...the next generation of terrorists will grow up in a digital world with ever more
powerful and easy-to-use hacking tools at their disposal... We cannot afford to shrug off
the threat. (Denning, 2001b:4)</p>
      <p>Yet it is important not to exaggerate the c y b e r terrorism threat. Terrorist
groups are making considerable use of the Internet but have not yet launched
a major cyber terrorism attack. It is likely that in the future terrorists will
continue to exploit new technological d e v e l o p m e n t s where it serves their goals
and offers a secure means of communication. There is an urgent need to
understand how the dynamics of new media technologies are affecting strategic
action in the terrorism war and how the public perceives such risks.
Instantaneous news coverage is made possible by the digital flow of information through
satellite technology. The traditional print and television media remain
important and television news, in particular, played a key role in breaking the news
of the September 11 attacks. The worldwide broadcasting o f terrorist attacks,
in many cases unfolding in real time, amplifies the effect on the global
political arena. Indeed, the events o f 9/11 have highlighted the changing role and
responsibility o f both traditional and new media in a globally enlarged public
sphere. H o w the news media rise to this challenge in the long term remains to
be seen, but clearly the World Trade Center attacks have provoked important
new lines o f critical questioning about risk, knowledge, and the media.</p>
